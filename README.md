## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) for the map
- [IPify Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/)

### What I learned

I practiced working with a third‑party API, mapping results on a Leaflet map, and building a responsive layout from a design image.

### Continued development

I want to improve validation and error handling, and add more polish to the UI.

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet Quick Start](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) - Helped me understand the basics of adding a map.
- [IPify Geolocation API Docs](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - Helped me understand how to make requests.
